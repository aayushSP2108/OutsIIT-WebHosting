# Campus Outlet Food Ordering Website

## Overview
This project is a web-based platform designed to make ordering food from various campus outlets easier. The website provides a simple and user-friendly interface for students, faculty, and visitors to explore available outlets, check menus, place orders, and manage carts efficiently. The design is inclusive and ensures accessibility, adhering to government guidelines on web accessibility.

## Why I Chose a Basic Template Over More Animated and Contrast-rich Designs [like my portfolio website](https://vipulsp2108.github.io/Project/)
While flashy and highly animated designs can be visually appealing, this website is built to cater to a broad community of users, including those with disabilities such as motion sickness and visual impairments. According to the **Government of India’s Web Accessibility Guidelines**, websites should prioritize simplicity and ease of use for everyone. This is why we focused on a design that is clean, minimal, and functional rather than being overly animated or distracting.

## Features

### Core Features
1. **Persistent Cart with Local Storage:**  
   Each outlet has its own cart, which is stored in JSON format within the browser’s localStorage. This ensures that users can reload the page or visit different outlets without losing their cart data.

2. **Multiple Outlets Support:**  
   Users can switch between different campus outlets, and each outlet maintains its own cart, allowing for easy multi-outlet shopping.

3. **Featured Section:**  
   A banner on the homepage highlights featured or newly added outlets to help users discover new places or deals.

4. **Dark Mode and Light Mode:**  
   Users can toggle between light and dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience, no matter the lighting environment.

5. **User-Friendly Interface:**  
   A simple and intuitive UI makes it easy to navigate and find what users need, whether they’re ordering food or just browsing menus.

6. **Responsive Design:**  
   The website is fully responsive and optimized for viewing on all devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

7. **Outlet-Specific Menus and Pricing:**  
   Each outlet has its own distinct menu and price list, allowing users to make informed decisions before adding items to their cart.

### Additional Features
1. **Outlet Timing & Grayscale for Closed Outlets:**  
   Outlets that are closed will have their sections shown in grayscale, and users will not be able to proceed to checkout for those outlets.

2. **Disabled Buttons for Closed Outlets:**  
   If an outlet is closed, the “Add to Cart” button for its items is disabled, preventing users from adding unavailable items to their cart.

3. **Real-time Cart Updates:**  
   As users select items from the menu, the cart is updated in real-time, reflecting quantity changes and total costs dynamically.

4. **Custom Banners for Each Outlet:**  
   Each outlet has a customized banner with key highlights, timings, and special offers, making it easier for users to explore.

5. **Accessibility-focused Design:**  
   The website adheres to basic web accessibility standards, ensuring compatibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation, making it more inclusive.

## Future Improvements
As the project continues to evolve, here are some planned features and improvements that we aim to implement:

1. **Two-Way Integration (Shopkeeper to Customer Communication):**  
   The website will soon support real-time communication between customers and shopkeepers for updates on orders, special requests, or general queries. *(This is already implemented in our app – [=[App APK Link (wait 60sec so it gets connected to sever)](https://vipulsp2108.github.io/Project/)*

2. **Payment Gateway Integration:**  
   We are planning to integrate secure payment methods, including UPI, card payments, and net banking, allowing for a seamless checkout experience.

3. **Light Mode Enhancement:**  
   Further refinements will be made to the light mode, enhancing readability and aesthetic appeal while keeping accessibility in mind.

4. **Interactive Elements:**  
   We plan to add more engaging elements, such as interactive menus, hover effects, and real-time chat options to enhance user experience.

5. **Expanded Content:**  
   Additional features such as student deals, special menus for events, and personalized recommendations based on user preferences are in development.

6. **Multilingual Support:**  
   To cater to a wider audience, we plan to introduce language selection, allowing users to view the website in different languages.

7. **Order History & Tracking:**  
   Users will soon be able to track the status of their orders in real-time, along with accessing past orders to make repeat purchases easier.

8. **Review and Rating System:**  
   Users will be able to rate their experience with outlets and leave reviews, helping others make better choices.

## Conclusion
This website aims to make the campus dining experience seamless, accessible, and efficient. With constant improvements and new features in the pipeline, we are committed to offering the best possible user experience.
